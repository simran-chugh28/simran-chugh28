ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Simran, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences in Potsdam, Germany. I'm passionate about coding, mathematicsâ€”especially calculus and statisticsâ€”and visualizing data to uncover insights. 

My GitHub showcases my projects and experiments in data science, including machine learning models, statistical analyses, and data visualizations. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me if you share similar interests or have collaboration ideas!
